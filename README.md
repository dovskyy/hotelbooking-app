Certainly, here's a README.md file for your Spring Boot project named HotelBooking, which is designed for managing hotel reservations:

# HotelBooking - Hotel Reservation Management App

HotelBooking is a Spring Boot application that allows you to manage hotel reservations. This project serves as a demonstration of various Spring Boot concepts, including controllers, repositories, and models.

## Key Classes

### 1. HotelBooking.java (Model)

The `HotelBooking` class represents a hotel reservation and contains information such as the customer's name, check-in date, check-out date, number of guests, and more.

### 2. BookingController.java (Controller)

The `BookingController` class is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to hotel reservations. It provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting reservations.

### 3. BookingRepository.java (Repository)

The `BookingRepository` interface extends Spring Data JPA's `JpaRepository` and allows you to perform database operations on hotel reservations, such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA.

3. Run the Spring Boot application.

4. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

Here is a list of available API endpoints:

- `GET /bookings/all`: Retrieve a list of all reservations.
- `GET /bookings/affordable/{price}`: Retrieve reservations with a price per night less than or equal to the specified price.
- `POST /bookings/create`: Create a new reservation by providing a JSON payload.
- `GET /bookings/delete/{id}`: Delete a reservation by specifying its ID.

## Technologies Used

The HotelBooking project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL (or other database of your choice)
- Maven (for dependency management)
- Git (for version control)

## Database Configuration

To configure the connection to your MySQL database, open the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory and adjust the database connection settings:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hotel_booking
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

## Project Expansion

The HotelBooking project can be expanded by adding additional features, such as user authentication, support for different types of hotel rooms, online payment integration, and more. Feel free to customize the project to suit your requirements.
